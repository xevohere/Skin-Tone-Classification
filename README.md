# Skin Tone Classification

Skin Tone Classification is a deep learning project aimed at promoting fairness and inclusivity by accurately classifying skin tones into four categories: **bright, mid-light, mid-dark, and dark**. This model has potential applications in **cosmetics, healthcare, and inclusive technology design**.

## 📌 Overview

Traditional methods using color space transformations fail under diverse lighting and skin tones. This project leverages the power of **deep convolutional neural networks** — **ResNet50**, **InceptionV3**, and **MobileNetV2** — trained on a rich and diverse dataset to improve classification performance and generalization.

## 🧠 Models Used

- **ResNet50** (Highest accuracy: **89.1%**)
- **InceptionV3** (Accuracy: 87.5%)
- **MobileNetV2** (Lightweight, good for mobile and real-time use)

## 📊 Dataset & Preprocessing

- A **diverse and balanced dataset** was used to cover various ethnicities and lighting conditions.
- Images were resized and normalized.
- Train:Validation:Test split — **80:10:10**
- Applied **data augmentation** to improve robustness.

## ⚙️ Training Details

- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- **Validation**: k-Fold Cross-Validation  

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

This project is part of my personal research into inclusive AI systems and was built with a focus on fairness, ethics, and real-world applicability. Inspired by ongoing challenges in representation and diversity in machine learning models.

Special thanks to the open-source community and deep learning pioneers whose work made this possible.
